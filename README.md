## Overview
[Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/), the PC survival game based on Norse mythology, offers a rudimentary set of in-game building tools that can be used to create a rich variety of player-built structures and buildings.

This project contains world files for a town called Skara Brae, home to a large number of unique and interesting buildings, arranged in the layout of a typical medieval town.

Additionally, this project also contains versions of Skara Brae that offer a scavenger hunt player quest, allowing one or more players to search for secrets within and outside of Skara Brae, to lift a curse placed on the town by Odin.

## Versions

Lower-performing computers may encounter frame rate performance issues running worlds containing large numbers of player-built structures, such as those within Skara Brae, especially if those structures contain lit torches and fires.  As such, this project offers four versions of Skara Brae, based on performance impact caused by light sources.  From order of least demanding to most demanding, the versions are: mostly unlit; outside torches lit; all torches lit; all torches and fires lit.  Players should choose and install the version most appropriate for their computer hardware.

Additionally, this project also contains versions of Skara Brae that offer a scavenger hunt player quest, allowing one or more players to search for secrets within and outside of Skara Brae, to lift a curse placed on the town by Odin.

## How to Install
Choose the version of Skara Brae to install from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dejayc/valheim-town-skara-brae/releases/tag/v1.0.0), based on computer performance and whether the quest is desired, and download the corresponding world files.

Copy the `Skara Brae.db` and `Skara Brae.fwl` world files into your Valheim `worlds` directory, usually located in Windows user directory `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE>\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds`.  You can use the directory alias `%UserProfile` in your path address if you prefer: `%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds`
